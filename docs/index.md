Make sure that the onboard router has access to the internet during the setup.

Depending on your router and onboard PC you may need to follow instructions included in [NETWORK](NETWORK.md) section.

To follow with this instruction you don't have to follow official guidelines for setting network presented in [Clearpath documentation](https://clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/foxy/husky/HuskyNetwork.html).

## Sensors

All sensors connected to the robot should be correctly identified at the startup to avoid serial port conflicts. If you want to connect new sensor over USB port, follow the instructions in the [SENSORS](SENSORS.md).
